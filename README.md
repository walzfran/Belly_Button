# Belly_Button
#### Project Overview
###### This project was to build a website to help users analyze information based on a certain subject and thier belly button. It shows the frequency of washes, the top 10 bacteria strains found in a bar chart as well as a bubble chart that shows all strains and the prevalence based on bubble size. 
###### I was able to get all of the graphs to populate and then I worked on formatting. For the bubbles chart I used the "Blues" color scheme and then worked on formatting the other charts to match the color scheme. I then found an image that worked with the color scheme that I was using. Once I put in the image, I changed the color and font of the webpage header. I then inserted a paragraph to go over how the website works and what it will populate. I also changed the layout of the charts to what I thought worked better as a flow, initially it was the bar, gauge and then bubble but I thought it looked nicer as the gauge, bar and then bubble as it is the largest graph. Below are a few screenshots showing what was done for formatting.
